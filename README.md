4) Use the Flask backend to handle the form submission and process the data.
- Folder Structure:
5) Organize the project with separate folders for the frontend and backend.
- Docker Configuration:
6) Create a Dockerfile for both the frontend and backend.
7) Write a .yaml file (Docker Compose) to connect both services in the same network.
8) Upload both images to docker hub and push your whole code to github and add the node_modules and other non required files(.vscode) in .gitignore
